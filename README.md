FVWM
----

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fvwmorg/fvwm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fvwmorg/fvwm)

Welcome to fvwm.  Fvwm is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager,
originally (a looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

Fvwm is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature set, be
extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of Motif mwm
compatibility.

**ALL VERSIONS OF FVWM PRIOR TO 2.6.X ARE NOT SUPPORTED UPSTREAM.**

Users of fvwm prior to 2.6.X can make use of the
[./bin/fvwm-convert-2.6.in](fvwm-convert-2.6 utility) to try and have their
configuration file converted to a newer syntax.  Please see its manpage for
more details on how to use it.

Installation
------------

See [the installation instructions](./INSTALL.md)

Development
-----------

Those interested in contributing to FVWM should have [a read of the developer
documentation](./docs/DEVELOPERS.md).

A [TODO file](./TODO.md) exists, and sometimes even things from it are worked
on.

Comments, Questions?
--------------------

There is the `#fvwm` IRC channel on `freenode.net` which you can use to chat
to people about FVWM.

If you have any questions, concerns, bug reports, enhancement requests,

Have fun!

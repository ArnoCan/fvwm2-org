                   A Quick Guide to the Default FVWM Desktop
                   =========================================

This file explains how to use your new FVWM desktop. We're assuming that you've
set up a desktop using the setup form from the default install, and that you've
not yet started modifying the results. We strongly encourage you to modify
that setup, but since we don't know how you may modify it, we'll have to
document what we _do_ know about. We apologise for any inconvenince this may 
cause ;)

                                  An Overview
                                  ===========

On startup, your desktop should look something like this.

Don't worry if the panel appears oversized - you can hide it with Alt + P.
You may wish to change that - See "Changing The Panel Hotkey"

This is what all the bits do:

1 Background. Click on this for a menu.

2 Monitor apps. This is a column of three buttons displaying the time, whether
  email is waiting in /var/spool and CPU usage. Additionally, clicking
  on the clock will launch a calendar app, if any can be detected, the
  mail button will launch a mail client, and the CUP button invokes a
  TOP listing.

3 Pager. The setup script configures FVWM with four large virtual desktops,
  each with nine pages. The pager displays a map of the pages on one
  of those desks. This is initially desk zero, but can be altered using
  the sliders. Clicking on a page will change to viewport to view that
  page, while right clicking will centre the viewport on the point
  clicked. Right dragging will scroll the viewport over the virtual
  desktop and middle clicking on a window in the pager will allow you
  to drag and move it. See FvwmPager for full details.

4 Control Bar. The control bar is a strip of buttons to control the
  pager and desktop. The layout is like this

	-----------------------------
	|  <  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  >  |
	-----------------------------

  The double size buttons marked "<" and ">" are called sliders. If the pager
  is unhidden and a slider is clicked, the pager will cycle forward (or
  backwards) through the desks, one desk per click. Desks are colour
  coded to make it easy to tell which one is being displayed. If the
  pager is currently hidden, or if the right mouse button is used,
  the viewport is switched to the desk instead.

  The numbered buttons change the viewport to the desk corresponding to
  the number.

5 Launcher Buttons. These are three buttons that when clicked launch a
  web browser, a terminal with a shell prompt, and a file
  manager. Attempts are made to autodetect available apps and choose
  sensible defaults. Additionally, the Shell button will launch a
  FvwmConsole window if right clicked, and if middle clicked, a popup
  panel of coloured terminals will appear. (One of the authors likes
  to colour code his terms).

6 Quit Button. Left click launches a "did you really mean it" popup, while
  right click restarts the window manager

7 Taskbar. This tracks all entities on the current page. Clicking a button will 
  iconify/de-iconify the corresponding window, while right clicking will summon
  the window operations menu, again for the corresponding window.

                           Changing The Panel Hotkey
                           =========================

The scope of setting up keys to work with X11 is out of context with
Fvwm, but in general the Alt key is already mapped and setup for use.
To manipulate the key sequences, there's two programs you should use.
The first is xev(1) -- "xev" will listen for key events and spit out
useful information about them.  If you can get the keycode for it, then
you can tell Xmodmap exactly how it is to function.  So if we take for
example, the left Windows Key.  xev gives me:

KeyRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x5e00001,
    root 0x40, subw 0x0, time 1478057097, (84,48), root:(952,746),
    state 0x20, keycode 115 (keysym 0xffeb, Super_L), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:  ""

The things to note here are the keycode (115).  We need to tell Xmodmap
to map keycode 115 to something useful to us.  Hence the command:

xmodmap -e "keycode 115 = LeftWin"

With that command we can now refer to the left Windows keys "LeftWin".
The next thing is to tell X11 that this key is also going to act as a
modifier, hence:

xmodmap -e "add mod4 = LeftWin"

Then FVWM will know that whenever we press it, it will act as such.
Note that you can add the two commmands above to your ~/.xsession file,
or as commands in the StartFunction if you wish.  For further details
see:  http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/faq/#5.5

                             Design Considerations.
                             ======================

We've tried to walk some fine lines with the design of this
configuration. We wanted something up to date, but which did not
rely on external software (like gkrellm or torsmo for instance) being
installed. We also wanted something simple enough to be easily understood,
but which also demonstrated some of the possibilities inherent in
FVWM. We wanted a look that was distinctive, but not so alien that the
user could not quickly learn the interface.  We wanted a desktop that
could be comfortably used for real world tasks, but not one that was so
cozy as to discourage users from tweaking, hacking, replacing or rewriting
the configuration.

The last point is important. FVWM is all about choice. It's about
flexibility. It can be thought of as a meta-window-manager, one that lets
you choose not only the graphics and appearance, you choose the interface
that suits you as well. 

Don't get me wrong, we'll be delighted if you use this design and find it
useful. But we'll be happier still if it inspires you to design your own.

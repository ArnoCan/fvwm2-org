Welcome To FVWM

Fast and lightweight, FVWM is probably the most completely customisable
window manager in existence. It won't currently fry the eggs for your
breakfast or take the dog for a walk, but for most purposes short of
that FVWM can probably do what you want.

The default configuration does not begin to hint at the possibilities. In
fact the default configuration is the minimal one we could conceive
of that wasn't actively ugly. This is partly to make sure that FVWM
will run out of the box on older machines (we tested this on a P166)
and partly because we don't want to encourage any preconceived notions
of what FVWM should be like. We're not talking about the "change the
wallpaper and icons" themes of some packages. With FVWM you can define
almost every aspect of the interface. If that isn't enough, FVWM comes
with a scripting module to define your own X11 forms and screens and a
module interface that allows you add functionality by writing modules
in Perl, C or other languages.

The best way to get an idea of the sheer versatility of FVWM is to look
at the screenshot gallery on the FVWM homepage [A]. For most of them you
can install the configuration file and just go[1]. Alternatively you
can code your own from scratch and get something uniquely your own.

Customising FVWM
================

FVWM installs its config files into $HOME/.fvwm. The default file
processed by the WM on startup is $HOME/.fvwm/config (and not .fvwm2rc
as was the case until recently). The config file takes the form of a
series of scripting commands, so the file is user editable. Changes made
to this file will alter the look and behaviour of FVWM.

Don't be afraid to experiment. In  the worst case you can delete the
config which will restore you to the default configuration. Just remember
to keep a backup if you have a lot of work invested in your setup!


Useful resources:
=================

The fvwm man page

	Yes, it's big, It also has everything you might conceivable want
	to know about FVWM. There's no need to read it all at once though.

The Fvwm module manuals.
	FvwmButtons, FvwmPager, FvwmIconMan... There are too many to
	list here. Again, you don't need to read them all at once,
	just to be aware that they are there to begin with

The FVWM Home Page [B] The FVWM Forum [C] The FVWM Wiki [D]
	Full of resources, including FAQs screenshots, configs
	and HOWTOs.

The Fvwm Beginners Guide [E]
	A good basic howto

taviso's config [F]
	A popular configuration used as a starting point by many FVWM
	newcomers.

There's undoubtedly more, but that should suffice to get you started

Welcome to FVWM. It's going to be an adventure...
